    "* Ethereum\n",
    "    * **Ethereum** (ETH, Ξ) is one of the main forms of cryptocurrencies used to purchase / trade for an NFT\n",
    "    * Other alternatives include **Bitcoin** (BTC, ₿), **Dogecoin** (DOGE, Ð)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* NFTs\n",
    "    * **NFT** is an acronym for a **<u>Non-Fungible</u> Token**, **Non-Fungible** meaning *one-of-a-kind*, not interchangeable\n",
    "    * These are tokens that are **generated on the blockchain** that can be traded like any other cryptocurrency\n",
    "    * These tokens are **unique** and store *metadata* information that links the token to a unique asset\n",
    "    * On the blockchain, NFT transactions are *publicized*, and proof of ownership (of the token, *not* always the asset) is established via the last completed transaction\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* NFT value\n",
    "    * The **value** of an NFT rises and falls due to **supply** and **demand**\n",
    "        * Supply is **negatively** correlated to price (*digital scarcity*)\n",
    "        * Demand is **positively** correlated to price\n",
    "    * NFTs *can* accrue their value over time, although this network will only work on the **current snapshot** of existing NFTs\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* NFT Scams\n",
    "    * An **NFT scam** (or *\"rug-pull\"*) is the act of claiming *all* or *most* of the cryptocurrency that was used to purchase an NFT, and **purposefully** not fulfilling expectations (such as *roadmaps*, *plans*, and *statements regarding the future of the tokens*)\n",
    "    * NFT scams are *fairly* common, and range from high to low effort baiting\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fun Facts\n",
    "    * NFT scammers tend to funnel money into *private* wallets, and use services such as **Tornado Cash** to obscure the trail of transactions out of the account by distributing the money in varying quantities throughout a *vast* number of wallets\n",
    "    * The creator of the [Pixelmon NFTs](https://opensea.io/ThePixelmonGame?tab=created) has made a total of **$73m USD** (25,080.73 Ξ) *as of 3/3/22*"
